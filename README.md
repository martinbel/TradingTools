## TradingTools

The idea of the package is to help traders and investors with common tasks.
Documentation is still in early stages but I'll try to improve it over time. 

## Installation

`remotes::install_github("martinbel/TradingTools")`

## Stock Screener

This library is what powers a stock screener I've developed for myself. 
You can download the app [here](https://github.com/martinbel/StockScreener).
